### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS with design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for component definitions)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)
- **Additional Libraries**: Lucide React (available for icons), shadcn/ui components

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/WhatToExpectSection.tsx` - New section component
