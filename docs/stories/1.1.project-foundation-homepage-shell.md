# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Homepage Shell

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Project Owner,
**I want** the Next.js project initialized, connected to a GitHub repository, and deployed to Vercel,
**so that** a foundational CI/CD pipeline is established and a live URL exists.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js project is created using the latest stable version.
2. The project is configured to use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
3. A new repository is created on GitHub and the project code is pushed.
4. The GitHub repository is connected to a new Vercel project.
5. A basic, unstyled "Homepage" page is created and displays the text "Aha Agile Coming Soon".
6. The initial deployment to Vercel succeeds, and the live Vercel URL correctly displays the homepage.
7. Jest and React Testing Library are installed and configured.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs - this is the first story

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for frontend and backend)
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (Primary framework for UI, routing, and serverless functions)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Core library for building UI components)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS framework for styling)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit and integration testing framework)
- **Linting**: ESLint ~8.57.0 (Code linting and style enforcement)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Hosting, CI/CD, and serverless platform)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
The project must follow the standard Next.js `app` router directory structure:
- `/src/app/` - Next.js App Router with `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout component
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage component
- `/src/components/` - Reusable React components with `ui/` and `layout/` subdirectories
- `/src/lib/` - Libraries and utilities
- `/src/styles/` - Global styles including `globals.css`
- `/.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows (future)
- `/content/` - Markdown content files (future)
- `/public/` - Static assets
- `/tests/` - Test files with `e2e/` subdirectory for Playwright tests

### Development Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-development-workflow.md]
- Use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Create `.env.local` file structure for future environment variables
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Must support both local development and production builds

### Configuration Files Required
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Jest testing configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

### Security & Performance Standards
[Source: architecture/7-security-and-performance.md]
- **Dependencies**: Must use `npm audit` for dependency security checking
- **HTTPS**: Vercel enforces HTTPS automatically
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Homepage will be statically generated for performance
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js `<Image>` component for future images
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Avoid heavy client-side JavaScript bundles

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript with strict mode
- **API Calls**: Use native `fetch` API for client-side requests
- **Environment Variables**: Server-side only, never expose to client
- **Shared Types**: Define in `src/types` directory as project grows

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for key UI components and utility functions
- **Specific requirements for this story**: 
  - Create initial test for homepage component rendering
  - Test that homepage displays "Aha Agile Coming Soon" text
  - Test root layout component functionality
  - Configure Jest for Next.js with proper module resolution

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-26
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation quality. The project foundation is solid with proper Next.js App Router setup, TypeScript configuration, and clean component architecture. The code follows modern React patterns with appropriate use of TypeScript interfaces and Next.js conventions.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/app/layout.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Improved test structure and suppressed expected DOM nesting warnings
  - **Why**: The original tests were generating console warnings due to testing full HTML structure (html/body tags within test containers)
  - **How**: Added proper error suppression for DOM nesting warnings (expected when testing Next.js layouts) and improved test descriptions for clarity

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with TypeScript strict mode, proper component structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect adherence to unified project structure with src/app/, src/components/, src/styles/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest and RTL properly configured with comprehensive test coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored layout tests to suppress expected DOM nesting warnings (src/app/layout.test.tsx)
- [x] Verified all dependencies match exact version requirements from tech stack
- [x] Confirmed build pipeline works correctly with static export configuration
- [x] Validated test coverage includes both component rendering and styling
- [x] Verified lint and build processes pass without errors

### Security Review
✓ No security concerns identified. Project follows security best practices:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety
- No exposed environment variables or secrets
- Dependencies are using specified stable versions
- Static site generation configured for optimal security

### Performance Considerations
✓ Excellent performance setup:
- Static site generation configured for optimal loading
- Next.js Image optimization ready for future use
- Minimal JavaScript bundle (87.4 kB first load)
- Tailwind CSS properly configured for production builds
- Homepage pre-rendered as static content

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Notes**: Outstanding implementation that exceeds expectations. The developer has properly followed all architectural guidelines, implemented comprehensive testing, and created a solid foundation for the Aha Agile website. All refactoring has been completed and the codebase is production-ready.
