### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/ServicesHeroSection.tsx` - New services hero section component

- Typography hierarchy that emphasizes financial impact
- Professional styling appropriate for consultancy audience

### Four Problem Areas Specifications
**Required Problem Cards:**
1. **Time Drain**: Focus on hours lost to email management and administrative tasks
2. **Billing Inefficiency**: Partners doing low-value work instead of billable activities
3. **Client Frustration**: Delayed responses and communication gaps

**Visual Requirements:**
- Appropriate Lucide React icon for each problem area (Clock, DollarSign, Users, Zap)
- Professional card layout with hover effects
- Descriptive content highlighting specific pain points
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 4 columns desktop)

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Mobile: 320px-768px (single column layout, stacked content, condensed hero)
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (optimized layout, 2-column problem grid)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (full visual impact, 4-column problem grid, expanded hero treatment)
