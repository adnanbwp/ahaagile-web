# Story 1.4: Case Study Page Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** potential Client,
**I want** to read a detailed case study,
**so that** I can see evidence of Aha Agile's expertise and the ROI they deliver.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new page is created at the `/case-study` route.
2. The page uses the sitewide Layout component.
3. All content for the page is rendered from a local Markdown file (`/content/case-study.md`).
4. The page is fully responsive and well-formatted for readability.
5. The page includes a clear call-to-action button that links to the "Book a Consultation" page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Update Case Study page component to render markdown content (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.3.services-page-implementation.md]
- Markdown utility (`src/lib/markdown.ts`) is complete and working with TypeScript types
- react-markdown (~9.0.0) library is installed and configured
- Call-to-action link mapping pattern is established: `#consultation` anchors map to `/book-a-consultation` route
- Custom link renderer in react-markdown successfully intercepts anchor links
- Sitewide layout components (Header, Footer) are complete and working
- Next.js App Router is properly configured with client-side routing

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for responsive design)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for all components and utilities)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for page components)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/content/case-study.md` - Markdown content file (already exists)
- `/src/app/case-study/page.tsx` - Case Study page component (placeholder exists, needs implementation)
- `/src/lib/markdown.ts` - Markdown rendering utility (already exists from Story 1.3)
- `/src/app/case-study/page.test.tsx` - Test file for Case Study page (needs to be created)

**Architecture compliance:**
- Use Next.js App Router pattern with `page.tsx` in route directory
- Place utility functions in `src/lib/` directory (already implemented)
- Test files should be alongside component files

### Markdown Processing Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md, architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- Markdown files are stored in `/content/` directory for content management
- Use existing `src/lib/markdown.ts` utility as specified in project structure
- Content pages will be statically generated for performance (Jamstack pattern)
- **Already Implemented**: `react-markdown` (~9.0.0) for markdown processing
  - Provides React component-based rendering
  - Supports custom components for enhanced styling
  - Lightweight and compatible with Next.js SSG
  - Handles sanitization and security concerns

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-security-and-performance.md]
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Case Study page must be statically generated at build time
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Avoid heavy client-side JavaScript for fast load times
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component if any images are added

### Component Architecture Standards
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript with strict mode for all components and utilities
- **API Calls**: Use native `fetch` API if needed (not applicable for this story)
- **Environment Variables**: Server-side only access (not applicable for this story)

### Navigation Integration
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.core-layout-styling-navigation.md]
- Case Study page route `/case-study` already exists as placeholder
- Navigation links in Header component already route to `/case-study`
- Call-to-action must use Next.js Link component for `/book-a-consultation` route
- Existing layout structure will automatically wrap the Case Study page

### Call-to-Action Link Mapping
[Source: content/case-study.md, Story 1.3 Pattern]
- Markdown content contains anchor links: `[Book Your Free 15-Minute Process Audit](#consultation)`
- These anchor links must be mapped to route to `/book-a-consultation` page
- Use custom link renderer in react-markdown to intercept `#consultation` anchors (pattern established in Story 1.3)
- All call-to-action links should redirect to the booking page for lead generation

### Long-Form Content Styling Requirements
[Source: content/case-study.md analysis]
- Content contains extensive sections with headings, metrics, quotes, and lists
- Requires proper typography hierarchy for H1, H2, H3 headings
- Need responsive spacing and readability optimizations for long-form content
- Should maintain consistent styling with Services page but optimized for extensive reading
- Call-to-action buttons should be prominently styled throughout the content

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension (`src/app/case-study/page.test.tsx`)
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for key UI components and page rendering
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test Case Study page renders markdown content correctly
  - Test call-to-action buttons are present and have correct href attributes
  - Test page renders without errors and has proper accessibility attributes
  - Test responsive behavior using React Testing Library queries
  - Test that markdown utility properly processes long-form content
  - Test heading hierarchy and typography rendering
