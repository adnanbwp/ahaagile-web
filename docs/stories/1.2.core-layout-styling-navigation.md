## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-foundation-homepage-shell.md]
- Project foundation is complete with Next.js ~14.2.3, TypeScript ~5.4.5, and Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3
- Basic project structure is in place following unified project structure guide
- Jest ~29.7.0 and React Testing Library are configured and working
- Root layout at `src/app/layout.tsx` exists and can be extended

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for navigation)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for responsive design)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for components)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**Layout components must be placed in:**
- `/src/components/layout/` - Directory for Header, Footer components
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout file to be updated
- `/src/app/*/page.tsx` - Individual page routes for navigation

**New pages to create:**
- `/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services page route
- `/src/app/case-study/page.tsx` - Case study page route
- `/src/app/book-a-consultation/page.tsx` - Consultation page route

### Styling and Design Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-security-and-performance.md]
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: All pages will be statically generated for performance
- **Responsive Design**: Must work on desktop and mobile using Tailwind responsive utilities
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Avoid heavy client-side JavaScript, use Next.js Link for navigation

### Navigation Implementation Details
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
- Use Next.js App Router with proper `page.tsx` files in route directories
- Navigation links must use Next.js `Link` component for client-side routing
- Routes to implement: `/services`, `/case-study`, `/book-a-consultation`
- Future legal pages: `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service` (placeholder links only)

### Component Architecture Standards
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript with strict mode for all components
- **Component Location**: Layout components in `src/components/layout/`
- **Shared Types**: If needed, define in `src/types` directory

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for key UI components (Header, Footer)
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test Header component renders "Aha Agile" branding
  - Test navigation links are present and have correct href attributes
  - Test Footer component renders copyright notice and legal links
  - Test components render without errors and have proper accessibility attributes
  - Test responsive behavior using React Testing Library queries
