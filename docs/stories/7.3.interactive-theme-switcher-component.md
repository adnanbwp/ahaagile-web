## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
[Source: docs/stories/7.1.theme-context-state-management.md, 7.2.dynamic-theme-loading-system.md]
**Required from Story 7.1:**
- useTheme hook for accessing theme state and switching functions
- ThemeContext providing current theme and mode information
- Type-safe theme options ('ocean', 'sunset', 'forest') and modes ('light', 'dark')

**Required from Story 7.2:**
- Dynamic theme loading system with smooth transitions
- CSS class management for theme application
- Performance-optimized theme switching without layout shifts

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router with static export)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture with hooks)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS with design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety throughout)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit and integration testing)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/ui/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` - Main theme switcher component
- `/src/components/ui/ThemePreview.tsx` - Individual theme preview component
- `/src/components/ui/ModeToggle.tsx` - Light/dark mode toggle component
- `/src/components/ui/ThemeSwitcher.test.tsx` - Unit tests for theme switcher
- `/src/styles/theme-switcher.css` - Theme switcher specific styling (if needed)

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow existing UI component patterns in `/src/components/ui/`
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state
- Maintain shadcn/ui component library styling consistency
- Ensure static export compatibility for Vercel deployment

### Theme Configuration Integration
[Source: src/styles/themes/index.ts]
**Theme Data Structure:**
```typescript
const AVAILABLE_THEMES = [
  {
    name: 'Ocean',
    id: 'ocean',
    description: 'Deep blue ocean tones with excellent contrast',
    colors: {
      primary: 'hsl(200 100% 25%)',
      accent: 'hsl(180 100% 35%)',
      background: 'hsl(200 30% 98%)',
    }
  },
  // Sunset and Forest themes...
];
```

**Component Integration:**
- Import AVAILABLE_THEMES for theme preview generation
- Use theme metadata for visual previews and descriptions
- Integrate with existing theme color definitions
- Display theme colors using actual HSL values from configuration

### UI Design Requirements
**Visual Design:**
- Floating position: fixed bottom-right with appropriate margins (16-24px)
- Collapsible design: Compact when closed, expanded when active
- Color previews: Small circular swatches showing primary theme colors
- Mode toggle: Clear light/dark indicator with switch/toggle design
- Active state: Clear highlighting of currently selected theme and mode

**Interactive Design:**
- Hover states: Subtle elevation and color changes for better UX
- Click feedback: Immediate visual response on selection
- Transition animations: Smooth expand/collapse and selection feedback
- Loading states: Brief indication during theme switching (if needed)

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Mobile (320px - 767px):**
- Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px)
- Simplified layout with stacked theme previews
- Swipe-friendly interaction patterns
- Optimized positioning for mobile navigation

**Tablet (768px - 1023px):**
- Balanced layout with adequate spacing
- Touch and mouse interaction support
- Appropriate sizing for both orientations
- Consistent with desktop patterns but touch-optimized

**Desktop (1024px+):**
- Full feature set with hover states
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Developer-focused information display
- Optimal positioning for development workflow

### Accessibility Implementation
**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Tab order: Logical flow through theme options and mode toggle
- Arrow keys: Navigate between theme options
- Enter/Space: Select theme or toggle mode
- Escape: Close expanded switcher (if applicable)

**Screen Reader Support:**
- ARIA roles: Proper radiogroup for themes, switch for mode toggle
- ARIA labels: Descriptive labels for each theme and current selection
- ARIA descriptions: Additional context for theme characteristics
- Live regions: Announce theme changes to screen readers

**Visual Accessibility:**
- Focus indicators: Clear keyboard focus outlines
- Color contrast: Meet WCAG AA standards for all text and controls
- Motion: Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations
- Size targets: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile

### Component Architecture
**ThemeSwitcher Component:**
- Main container with state management
- Integration with useTheme hook
- Responsive layout handling
- Accessibility coordination

**ThemePreview Component:**
- Individual theme representation
- Color swatch display
- Selection state management
- Accessibility attributes

**ModeToggle Component:**
- Light/dark mode switching
- Visual state representation

### Performance Considerations
**Rendering Optimization:**
- Use React.memo for theme preview components
- Minimize re-renders during theme switching
- Efficient event handling for selections
- Lazy load theme data if needed

**CSS Optimization:**
- Use CSS-in-JS sparingly, prefer Tailwind classes
- Minimize custom CSS for better maintainability
- Optimize transition performance
- Consider CSS containment for isolated styling

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Standards:**
- **Unit Tests**: Component behavior, state management, accessibility
- **Integration Tests**: Theme switching workflow, context integration
- **Accessibility Tests**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Required Test Cases:**
- Theme selection triggers correct theme switching
- Light/dark mode toggle updates context state
- Keyboard navigation works correctly across all elements
- Component renders correctly across responsive breakpoints
- ARIA attributes are correctly applied for accessibility
- Visual feedback provides clear indication of current selections
- Component positioning doesn't interfere with page content
