- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)
- **Additional Libraries**: React Hook Form ~7.51.4, shadcn/ui (installed), Lucide React (available)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/ServicesCTASection.tsx` - New CTA section component
- `/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services page file (modify to include CTA section and enhance markdown styling)
- Test files: `/src/components/sections/ServicesCTASection.test.tsx`

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions with proper interfaces
- Maintain existing project structure while adding new section components
- Components must integrate with existing services page layout, hero section, grid section, and markdown content system

### Current Services Page Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
- Services page includes ServicesHeroSection (from story 4.1) at the top
- ServicesGridSection (from story 4.2) added between hero and markdown content
- Page uses ReactMarkdown to render content from `/content/services.md`
- Page has custom component styling for headings, paragraphs, links, and other markdown elements
- Existing services.md content includes comprehensive services information and business case details
- Content structure: hero, grid/process sections, then detailed markdown content with methodology, results, and existing CTAs
- Page uses container structure with proper semantic HTML and responsive design

**Required Integration:**
- CTA section must be added at the end of the page after all existing content
- Should preserve all existing hero, grid, and markdown content
- Must enhance existing ReactMarkdown component styling to use design system colors
- Should work seamlessly with existing component architecture
- CTA section should be the final conversion point after all informational content

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: CTA section components must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: CTA section must be built as reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All components contained within single repository structure
- **Performance**: Components must be optimized for fast loading and CDN delivery

### Design System Integration Requirements
**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use Loveable design tokens: navy primary (#1e3a8a), yellow accent (#fbbf24), sophisticated grays
- Apply Inter font for headings and Source Serif 4 for body text with proper typography hierarchy
- Use gradient backgrounds consistent with existing hero and grid section treatment
- Integrate with existing shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Badge) for CTA buttons
- Maintain professional consultancy brand positioning with sophisticated visual design
- CTA buttons must have professional hover effects and micro-interactions
- Enhanced markdown styling must use design system colors instead of hardcoded values

### Enhanced CTA Section Content Specifications
**Required CTA Section Content:**
- **Headline**: "Ready to Transform Your Workflows?" with professional styling and hierarchy
- **Compelling Copy**: Focus on transformation, measurable results, and next steps
- **Dual CTA Buttons**:
  1. **Primary CTA**: "Book Your Free Process Audit" (yellow accent button, links to /book-a-consultation)
  2. **Secondary CTA**: "Download Case Study" (navy outline button, links to /case-study)

**Visual Requirements:**
- Professional gradient background treatment consistent with existing sections
- Proper button hierarchy with primary/secondary styling distinction
- Professional spacing and layout for optimal conversion
- Compelling copy that reinforces the transformation message
- Responsive layout maintaining visual impact across all device sizes

### Markdown Component Enhancement Requirements
**Current ReactMarkdown Components to Enhance:**
- Update hardcoded colors (blue-600, blue-700, blue-800, gray-900, gray-800, gray-700) to use design system
- Replace with brand.navy and brand.yellow from tailwind config
- Maintain existing functionality while improving visual consistency
- Enhance link hover effects with smoother transitions
- Improve CTA button styling for consultation links
- Apply Inter font to headings while preserving Source Serif 4 for body text

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Mobile: 320px-768px (single column layout, stacked CTAs, condensed spacing)
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (optimized layout, side-by-side CTAs, maintained visual hierarchy)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (full visual impact, expanded CTA treatment, optimal conversion layout)
- Ensure smooth transitions and optimal visual impact at all breakpoints

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Proper semantic HTML structure for CTA section
- ARIA labels for CTA buttons and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators with sufficient contrast and visibility
- Screen reader compatibility with meaningful button descriptions
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Alternative text for any icons or visual elements

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Component props should be defined with TypeScript interfaces
- **API Calls**: CTA section components should not make API calls (pure UI components)
- **Environment Variables**: No client-side environment variable exposure needed

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components and interactive functionality
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test ServicesCTASection component renders with correct headline and compelling copy
  - Test dual CTA buttons with proper text, styling, and link functionality
  - Test enhanced ReactMarkdown component styling integration with design system colors
  - Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes (320px, 768px, 1024px+)
  - Test integration with existing services page structure (hero, grid, markdown, CTA sections)
  - Create snapshot tests to prevent visual regression in enhanced markdown styling
  - Verify accessibility features with screen reader compatibility testing
  - Test professional styling and design system integration throughout
  - Test hover effects and interactive element feedback
