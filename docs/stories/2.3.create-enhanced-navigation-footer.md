## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/2.1.update-design-tokens-color-system.md]
- Complete Loveable design system implemented with navy primary and yellow accent colors
- Typography system configured with Inter for headings and Source Serif 4 for body text
- CSS variables created for colors, gradients, shadows, and spacing
- Custom utility classes added for brand-specific patterns (buttons, cards, layout)
- Tailwind config updated with comprehensive design token system
- All existing components verified to work with new design tokens

[Source: docs/stories/2.2.install-configure-component-library.md]
- shadcn/ui component library will be installed and configured
- Lucide React icons will be available for consistent iconography
- Essential components (Button, Card, Badge, Separator) will be ready for use
- Component library integrated with existing Tailwind setup and design tokens

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for brand design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for component definitions)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)
- **Linting**: ESSlint ~8.57.0 (Code linting and style enforcement)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Main navigation component (exists, needs enhancement)
- `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` - Footer component (exists, needs enhancement)  
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout file (exists, imports Header/Footer)
- Test files should be created as `/src/components/layout/Header.test.tsx` and `/src/components/layout/Footer.test.tsx`

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions
- Maintain existing project structure while enhancing components
- Ensure components integrate with new design system from story 2.1

### Current Navigation Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
- Header component contains main navigation with links to: Home, Services, Case Study, Consultation
- Footer component exists with basic layout and content
- Components are imported in `/src/app/layout.tsx` root layout
- Navigation uses Next.js Link components for client-side routing
- Basic responsive design implemented but needs enhancement

**Required Enhancements:**
- Apply Loveable design tokens (navy primary, yellow accents, sophisticated grays)
- Implement professional mobile menu with smooth animations
- Add comprehensive accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use Inter typography for navigation elements
- Ensure proper contrast ratios and modern visual design patterns

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Enhanced components must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: Navigation and footer must be reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All component enhancements contained in single repository

### Design System Integration Requirements
**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use design tokens from story 2.1 (navy primary, yellow accent, sophisticated grays)  
- Apply Inter font for navigation text and headings
- Use CSS variables and custom utility classes created in previous story
- Integrate with shadcn/ui components if available from story 2.2
- Maintain professional appearance that reflects consultancy brand positioning

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Mobile: 320px-768px (hamburger menu, stacked layout)
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (condensed horizontal navigation)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (full horizontal navigation with enhanced styling)
- Ensure smooth transitions between breakpoints

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Proper semantic HTML structure for navigation and footer
- ARIA labels for interactive elements and mobile menu
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Focus indicators with sufficient contrast and visibility
- Screen reader compatibility with navigation hierarchy
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Component props should be defined with TypeScript interfaces
- **API Calls**: Navigation components should not make API calls (pure UI components)
- **Environment Variables**: No client-side environment variable exposure needed

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components and navigation functionality
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test navigation component renders with new design tokens
  - Test mobile menu functionality and animation behavior  
  - Test accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Test footer component rendering and responsive behavior
  - Test navigation link functionality and Next.js routing integration
  - Create snapshot tests to prevent visual regression
  - Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
  - Verify existing functionality is preserved after enhancements
