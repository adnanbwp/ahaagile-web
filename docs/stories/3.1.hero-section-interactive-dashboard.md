- **Additional Libraries**: React Hook Form ~7.51.4, shadcn/ui (installed), Lucide React (available)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx` - Main hero section component (new)
- `/src/components/ui/DashboardMockup.tsx` - Interactive dashboard component (new)
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage file (modify to include hero section)
- Test files: `/src/components/sections/HeroSection.test.tsx` and `/src/components/ui/DashboardMockup.test.tsx`

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions with proper interfaces
- Maintain existing project structure while adding new section components
- Ensure components integrate with existing layout (Header/Footer) and markdown content system

### Current Homepage Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
- Homepage uses markdown content from `/content/homepage.md` rendered via ReactMarkdown
- Existing styling includes btn-primary and btn-secondary classes
- Homepage has container structure with prose styling for markdown content
- Components use responsive design patterns and accessibility features

**Required Integration:**
- Hero section must integrate above existing markdown content
- Should use existing button styling patterns (btn-primary, btn-secondary)
- Must maintain responsive container structure
- Should work seamlessly with existing Header/Footer navigation

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Hero section components must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: Hero section must be built as reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All components contained within single repository structure
- **Performance**: Components must be optimized for fast loading and CDN delivery

### Design System Integration Requirements
**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use Loveable design tokens: navy primary (#1e3a8a), yellow accent (#fbbf24), sophisticated grays
- Apply Inter font for headline typography with proper hierarchy
- Use gradient backgrounds with brand-light to background transitions
- Integrate with existing shadcn/ui components (Button, Card) where appropriate
- Maintain professional consultancy brand positioning with sophisticated visual design

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Mobile: 320px-768px (stacked layout, smaller typography, condensed dashboard)
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (hybrid layout, medium typography, optimized dashboard view)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (full horizontal layout, large typography, expanded dashboard visualization)
- Ensure smooth transitions and optimal visual impact at all breakpoints

### Interactive Dashboard Requirements
**Dashboard Mockup Specifications:**
- Show time savings metrics with visual indicators (progress bars, charts, or animated counters)
- Display efficiency statistics with percentage improvements
- Include hover effects and micro-interactions for user engagement
- Use professional data visualization patterns appropriate for consultancy audience
- Ensure dashboard elements are accessible with proper ARIA labels and descriptions

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Proper semantic HTML structure for hero content hierarchy
- ARIA labels for interactive dashboard elements and CTA buttons
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators with sufficient contrast and visibility
- Screen reader compatibility with meaningful content descriptions
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Alternative text for all icons and visual elements

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Component props should be defined with TypeScript interfaces
- **API Calls**: Hero components should not make API calls (pure UI components)
- **Environment Variables**: No client-side environment variable exposure needed for hero section

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components and interactive functionality
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test HeroSection component renders with proper gradient background and typography
  - Test DashboardMockup component interactive elements and metrics display
  - Test CTA buttons functionality and Next.js routing integration
  - Test value points section rendering with icons and responsive behavior
  - Test trust indicators section display and logo grid layout
  - Create snapshot tests to prevent visual regression
