# Story 1.3: Services Page Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** potential Client,
**I want** to view a dedicated Services page,
**so that** I can understand the specific solutions offered by Aha Agile.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new page is created at the `/services` route.
2. The page uses the sitewide Layout component.
3. All content for the page is rendered from a local Markdown file (`/content/services.md`).
4. The page is fully responsive and displays correctly on desktop and mobile devices.
5. The page includes clear call-to-action buttons that link to the `/book-a-consultation` route, with markdown anchor links (`#consultation`) being mapped to this route.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create markdown utility for rendering content (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `src/lib/markdown.ts` utility for processing markdown files
  - [x] Include proper TypeScript types for markdown processing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.core-layout-styling-navigation.md]
- Sitewide layout components (Header, Footer) are complete and working
- Navigation structure is in place with `/services` route already created as placeholder
- Tailwind CSS configuration is set up with primary color scheme and typography
- Next.js App Router is properly configured with client-side routing

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for responsive design)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for all components and utilities)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for page components)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/content/services.md` - Markdown content file (already exists)
- `/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services page component (placeholder exists, needs implementation)
- `/src/lib/markdown.ts` - Markdown rendering utility (needs to be created)
- `/src/app/services/page.test.tsx` - Test file for Services page (needs to be created)

**Architecture compliance:**
- Use Next.js App Router pattern with `page.tsx` in route directory
- Place utility functions in `src/lib/` directory
- Test files should be alongside component files

### Markdown Processing Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md, architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- Markdown files are stored in `/content/` directory for content management
- Need to create `src/lib/markdown.ts` utility as specified in project structure
- Content pages will be statically generated for performance (Jamstack pattern)
- **Required Library**: Use `react-markdown` (~9.0.0) for markdown processing
  - Provides React component-based rendering
  - Supports custom components for enhanced styling
  - Lightweight and compatible with Next.js SSG
  - Handles sanitization and security concerns

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-security-and-performance.md]
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Services page must be statically generated at build time
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Avoid heavy client-side JavaScript for fast load times
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component if any images are added

### Component Architecture Standards
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript with strict mode for all components and utilities
- **API Calls**: Use native `fetch` API if needed (not applicable for this story)
- **Environment Variables**: Server-side only access (not applicable for this story)

### Navigation Integration
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.core-layout-styling-navigation.md]
- Services page route `/services` already exists as placeholder
- Navigation links in Header component already route to `/services`
- Call-to-action must use Next.js Link component for `/book-a-consultation` route
- Existing layout structure will automatically wrap the Services page

### Call-to-Action Link Mapping
[Source: content/services.md, PO Feedback]
- Markdown content contains anchor links: `[Book Your Free 15-Minute Process Audit](#consultation)`
- These anchor links must be mapped to route to `/book-a-consultation` page
- Use custom link renderer in react-markdown to intercept `#consultation` anchors
- All call-to-action links should redirect to the booking page for lead generation

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension (`src/app/services/page.test.tsx`)
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for key UI components and page rendering
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test Services page renders markdown content correctly
  - Test call-to-action buttons are present and have correct href attributes  
  - Test page renders without errors and has proper accessibility attributes
  - Test responsive behavior using React Testing Library queries
  - Test that markdown utility properly processes content

## PO Review Feedback

### 1. Missing Markdown Library Specification
**Issue**: Dev Notes mention "No specific guidance found in architecture docs for markdown library choice" but tasks reference markdown processing requirements.
**Action Required**: Add specific markdown library requirement (e.g., `react-markdown`, `next-mdx-remote`) to Dev Notes section.

### 2. Call-to-Action Implementation Details
**Issue**: AC5 mentions call-to-action linking to `/book-a-consultation` but the markdown content shows `[Book Your Free 15-Minute Process Audit](#consultation)` - inconsistent routing.
**Action Required**: Clarify whether markdown links should map to specific routes or if markdown content should be updated to use correct routing.
