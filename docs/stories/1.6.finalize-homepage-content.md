# Story 1.6: Finalize Homepage Content

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Visitor,
**I want** the Homepage to provide a clear summary and guide me to the most relevant content,
**so that** I can quickly understand what Aha Agile does and find what I need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The placeholder content on the Homepage is replaced with final copy, rendered from `/content/homepage.md`.
2. The page content effectively communicates the core value proposition.
3. The page includes at least two clear calls-to-action: one linking to the Case Study page and one linking to the "Book a Consultation" page.
4. All links on the page are functional.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement homepage markdown content rendering (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Update existing `src/app/page.tsx` to use markdown utility for `/content/homepage.md`
  - [ ] Remove placeholder "Aha Agile Coming Soon" content
  - [ ] Import and configure markdown processing utility from `src/lib/markdown.ts`
  - [ ] Apply responsive typography and spacing using Tailwind CSS classes
  - [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript typing for homepage component
  - [ ] Use Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance
- [ ] Task 2: Implement call-to-action navigation integration (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Map markdown anchor links (`#case-study`) to `/case-study` route using existing pattern
  - [ ] Map markdown anchor links (`#consultation`) to `/book-a-consultation` route using existing pattern
  - [ ] Style call-to-action buttons consistently with site design using Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Ensure all call-to-action links redirect correctly to target pages
  - [ ] Test navigation links work correctly with Next.js client-side routing
- [ ] Task 3: Create unit tests for updated Homepage (Testing Requirements)
  - [ ] Create `src/app/page.test.tsx` with rendering tests for homepage content
  - [ ] Test markdown content is properly displayed and formatted
  - [ ] Test call-to-action links route correctly to expected pages
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior and accessibility features
  - [ ] Verify test coverage meets project standards

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.4.case-study-page-implementation.md, docs/stories/1.3.services-page-implementation.md]
- Markdown utility (`src/lib/markdown.ts`) is complete and working with TypeScript types
- react-markdown (~9.0.0) library is installed and configured for markdown processing
- Call-to-action link mapping pattern is established and working: `#consultation` anchors map to `/book-a-consultation` route, `#case-study` anchors map to `/case-study` route
- Custom link renderer in react-markdown successfully intercepts anchor links for internal routing
- Sitewide layout components (Header, Footer) are complete and working with consistent navigation
- Next.js App Router is properly configured with client-side routing and SSG patterns
- Existing pattern for content pages: markdown files in `/content/` directory rendered by page components

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for responsive design)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for all components and utilities)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for page components)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/content/homepage.md` - Markdown content file (needs to be created or updated)
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage component (exists with placeholder, needs markdown implementation)
- `/src/lib/markdown.ts` - Markdown rendering utility (already exists from previous stories)
- `/src/app/page.test.tsx` - Test file for Homepage (needs to be created)

**Architecture compliance:**
- Use Next.js App Router pattern with `page.tsx` as homepage
- Place content in `/content/` directory following established pattern
- Test files should be alongside component files
- Utilize existing markdown processing infrastructure

### Markdown Processing Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md, architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- Markdown files are stored in `/content/` directory for content management
- Use existing `src/lib/markdown.ts` utility as specified in project structure
- Homepage will be statically generated for performance (Jamstack pattern)
- **Already Implemented**: `react-markdown` (~9.0.0) for markdown processing
  - Provides React component-based rendering
  - Supports custom components for enhanced styling
  - Lightweight and compatible with Next.js SSG
  - Handles sanitization and security concerns
  - Custom link renderer for internal navigation established in previous stories

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Static site generation for homepage content for maximum performance
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable React components for content rendering and CTAs
- **Monorepo Structure**: All frontend content in single repository

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-security-and-performance.md]
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Homepage must be statically generated at build time
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Avoid heavy client-side JavaScript for fast load times
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component if any images are added to homepage content

### Component Architecture Standards
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript with strict mode for all components and utilities
- **API Calls**: Use native `fetch` API if needed (not applicable for this story)
- **Environment Variables**: Server-side only access (not applicable for this story)

### Navigation Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.core-layout-styling-navigation.md]
- Homepage route `/` already exists with placeholder content
- Navigation links in Header component already route correctly
- Call-to-action must use Next.js Link component for internal routes
- Existing layout structure will automatically wrap the Homepage
- All internal links must use client-side routing for performance

### Call-to-Action Implementation Pattern
[Source: docs/stories/1.3.services-page-implementation.md, docs/stories/1.4.case-study-page-implementation.md]
- **Established Pattern**: Markdown anchor links are intercepted and converted to Next.js routing
- **Implementation**: Custom link renderer in `react-markdown` configuration
- **Target Routes**:
  - `#case-study` maps to `/case-study` route
  - `#consultation` maps to `/book-a-consultation` route
- **Styling**: Use consistent Tailwind CSS classes for button styling
- **Testing**: Verify routing behavior in unit tests

### Content Structure Requirements
- Homepage content should effectively communicate Aha Agile's core value proposition
- Content must guide visitors to relevant pages (services, case study, consultation)
- Multiple clear calls-to-action required for lead generation funnel
- Content should be optimized for conversion and user engagement

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components (homepage) and utility functions
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test homepage renders markdown content correctly
  - Test call-to-action links route to expected pages
  - Test responsive behavior and accessibility features
  - Test that page renders without errors and integrates with layout
  - Verify markdown processing works correctly with existing utility
  - Test static site generation works properly
