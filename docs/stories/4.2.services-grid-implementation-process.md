- **Additional Libraries**: React Hook Form ~7.51.4, shadcn/ui (installed), Lucide React (available)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/ServicesGridSection.tsx` - New services grid and process section component
- `/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services page file (modify to include grid section)
- Test files: `/src/components/sections/ServicesGridSection.test.tsx`

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions with proper interfaces
- Maintain existing project structure while adding new section components
- Components must integrate with existing services page layout, hero section, and markdown content system

### Current Services Page Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
- Services page currently includes ServicesHeroSection (from story 4.1) above ReactMarkdown content
- Page uses ReactMarkdown to render content from `/content/services.md`
- Page has custom component styling for headings, paragraphs, links, and other markdown elements
- Existing services.md content includes comprehensive services information and business case details
- Content structure: hero, problem statement, services overview, methodology, results, and CTAs
- Page uses container structure with proper semantic HTML and responsive design

**Required Integration:**
- Grid section must integrate between hero section and existing markdown content
- Should preserve existing services.md content while adding new interactive grid section
- Must maintain professional B2B tone and messaging consistency throughout
- Should work seamlessly with existing ReactMarkdown rendering and custom components
- Grid should enhance, not replace, the existing detailed services content in markdown

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Grid section components must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: Grid section must be built as reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All components contained within single repository structure
- **Performance**: Components must be optimized for fast loading and CDN delivery

### Design System Integration Requirements
**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use Loveable design tokens: navy primary (#1e3a8a), yellow accent (#fbbf24), sophisticated grays
- Apply Inter font for headings with proper typography hierarchy
- Use gradient backgrounds consistent with existing hero section treatment
- Integrate with existing shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge) for service cards and analysis sections
- Maintain professional consultancy brand positioning with sophisticated visual design
- Service cards must have professional hover effects and micro-interactions
