## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
[Source: docs/stories/7.1.theme-context-state-management.md]
**Required from Story 7.1:**
- ThemeProvider component with theme state management
- useTheme hook for accessing current theme and switching functions
- Theme context providing type-safe theme options ('ocean', 'sunset', 'forest')
- localStorage persistence and hydration logic

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router with static export)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS with design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety throughout)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit and integration testing)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with ThemeProvider integration
- `/src/lib/theme-loader.ts` - Dynamic CSS loading utilities
- `/src/styles/themes/` - Existing theme CSS files (Ocean, Sunset, Forest)
- `/src/styles/theme-transitions.css` - Transition animations for theme switching
- `/src/lib/theme-loader.test.ts` - Unit tests for theme loading functionality

**Architecture compliance:**
- Maintain Next.js App Router patterns with dynamic CSS loading
- Use TypeScript for theme loading utilities and type definitions
- Preserve existing project structure while enhancing theme capabilities
- Ensure static export compatibility for Vercel deployment

### Theme CSS Configuration
[Source: src/styles/themes/index.ts and existing CSS files]
**Existing theme structure:**
- **Ocean theme**: `src/styles/themes/ocean.css` - Deep blue ocean tones
- **Sunset theme**: `src/styles/themes/sunset.css` - Warm orange/red colors
- **Forest theme**: `src/styles/themes/forest.css` - Natural green tones

**CSS Variable Structure:**
- Uses HSL space-separated values (e.g., "200 100% 25%")
- Compatible with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Includes comprehensive light and dark mode variants
- Covers all standard shadcn/ui color variables (background, foreground, primary, etc.)

### Dynamic Loading Requirements
**CSS Class Management:**
- Apply theme classes dynamically to `document.documentElement`
- Remove previous theme classes before applying new ones
- Use class naming pattern: `theme-ocean`, `theme-sunset`, `theme-forest`
- Handle both theme switching and light/dark mode switching

**Performance Considerations:**
- Minimize CSS bundle size impact
- Prevent layout shifts during theme transitions
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (CLS < 0.1)
- Implement efficient CSS loading without blocking rendering

### Tailwind CSS Integration
**Configuration Requirements:**
- Theme CSS variables must override default Tailwind color values
- Ensure proper CSS cascade order for theme precedence
- Maintain compatibility with existing custom Tailwind configuration
- Preserve design system tokens while enabling theme switching

**CSS Cascade Strategy:**
- Theme variables defined in `:root` with higher specificity
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic color values
- Ensure theme classes take precedence over default styling
- Maintain component-specific styling while enabling theme overrides

### Transition and Animation Requirements
**Smooth Theme Switching:**
- Implement CSS transitions for color properties only (avoid layout properties)
- Use optimal transition duration (150-300ms) for perceived performance
- Include easing functions for natural feel (`ease-in-out`)
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility compliance

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for performant animations
- Avoid animating layout-affecting properties
- Implement efficient CSS selector strategies
- Test on lower-end devices for performance validation

### Component Integration Strategy
**Layout Integration:**
- Integrate ThemeProvider at root layout level
- Apply theme classes to document element for global effect
- Ensure theme switching doesn't break existing component functionality
- Maintain component isolation while enabling theme overrides

**Component Testing Strategy:**
- Test all UI components (`/src/components/ui/`) with each theme
- Verify layout components (Header, Footer) maintain styling
- Test page-specific sections with theme variations
- Ensure form components and interactive elements work correctly

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Standards:**
- **Unit Tests**: Located alongside component files using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Dynamic CSS loading, theme switching, and component rendering
- **Integration Tests**: Full theme switching workflow with visual integrity validation

**Required Test Cases:**
- CSS class application and removal on document element
- Theme CSS loading and unloading functionality
- Transition performance and animation behavior
- Component styling integrity across all themes
- Reduced motion preference respect
- Layout stability during theme transitions
- Tailwind CSS compatibility and cascade behavior
