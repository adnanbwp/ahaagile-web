# Story 7.4: Integration & Testing

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** comprehensive integration testing of the theme system,

4. No visual regressions or styling conflicts occur when switching between themes.
5. Theme system works correctly with existing Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styling.
6. Unit tests are created for theme context, switching logic, and component rendering.
7. Theme persistence functionality is tested across browser sessions and different devices.
8. Performance impact of theme switching is measured and optimized for smooth user experience.
9. Theme system can be easily removed or disabled for production builds when theme selection is finalized.
