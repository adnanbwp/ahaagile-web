# Story 7.4: Integration & Testing

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** comprehensive integration testing of the theme system,
**so that** all themes work correctly with existing components and the system is ready for theme selection decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Theme switcher is integrated into the main layout component for global accessibility.
2. All existing components (header, footer, hero sections, buttons, cards) are tested with each theme variant.
3. Theme compatibility is verified across all pages (homepage, services, case study, consultation).
4. No visual regressions or styling conflicts occur when switching between themes.
5. Theme system works correctly with existing Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styling.
6. Unit tests are created for theme context, switching logic, and component rendering.
7. Theme persistence functionality is tested across browser sessions and different devices.
8. Performance impact of theme switching is measured and optimized for smooth user experience.
9. Theme system can be easily removed or disabled for production builds when theme selection is finalized.

- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit and integration testing)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ~1.44.0 (End-to-end testing framework)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Integration of ThemeSwitcher component
- `/tests/integration/theme-system.test.tsx` - Integration tests for theme system
- `/tests/visual/theme-regression.test.ts` - Visual regression tests
- `/tests/performance/theme-performance.test.ts` - Performance impact tests
- `/tests/e2e/theme-switching.spec.ts` - End-to-end theme switching tests
- `/src/lib/theme-config.ts` - Production configuration utilities

**Architecture compliance:**
- Maintain Next.js App Router patterns with integrated theme system
- Use TypeScript for all test files and configuration utilities
- Follow existing test structure patterns and naming conventions
- Ensure static export compatibility remains intact

### Integration Testing Strategy
**Layout Integration:**
- ThemeSwitcher positioned for optimal development workflow
