### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS with Loveable design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for component definitions)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)
- **Additional Libraries**: React Hook Form ~7.51.4, shadcn/ui (installed), Lucide React (available)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/ProblemSection.tsx` - Main problem section component (new)
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage file (modify to include problem section below hero)
- Test files: `/src/components/sections/ProblemSection.test.tsx`

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions with proper interfaces
- Maintain existing project structure while adding new section components
- Ensure components integrate with existing layout (Header/Footer/Hero) and content system

### Current Homepage Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
- Homepage uses HeroSection component above markdown content from `/content/homepage.md`
- Existing styling includes gradient backgrounds and responsive design patterns
- Homepage has container structure with proper semantic HTML for SEO
- Components use responsive design patterns and accessibility features

**Required Integration:**
- Problem section must integrate below hero section and above existing markdown content
- Should use existing design system patterns (gradient backgrounds, card styling)
- Must maintain responsive container structure
- Should work seamlessly with existing Header/Footer/Hero components

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Problem section components must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: Problem section must be built as reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All components contained within single repository structure
- **Performance**: Components must be optimized for fast loading and CDN delivery

### Design System Integration Requirements
**Critical Requirements:**
- Must use Loveable design tokens: navy primary (#1e3a8a), yellow accent (#fbbf24), sophisticated grays
- Apply Inter font for section header typography with proper hierarchy
- Use gradient backgrounds and card styling consistent with hero section
- Integrate with existing shadcn/ui components (Card, Button) for pain point cards
- Maintain professional consultancy brand positioning with sophisticated visual design

### Pain Points Content Specifications
**Required Pain Points with Descriptions:**
1. **Time Drain**: Manual processes consuming excessive employee hours and reducing productivity
2. **Hidden Costs**: Invisible expenses from inefficient workflows and repeated manual tasks
3. **Error Prone**: Human mistakes in manual processes leading to costly corrections and delays
4. **Employee Burnout**: Repetitive manual work reducing job satisfaction and increasing turnover

**Visual Requirements:**
- Each pain point should have appropriate Lucide React icon (Clock, DollarSign, AlertTriangle, Frown)
- Professional card layout with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- Hover effects that enhance engagement without disrupting accessibility

### Financial Impact Requirements
**Display Specifications:**
- Prominent callout with "$236K - $330K Annual Cost of Inefficiency" headline
- Gradient background treatment consistent with design system
- Typography hierarchy that emphasizes the financial impact data
- Responsive scaling that maintains impact across all device sizes

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Mobile: 320px-768px (single column layout, condensed cards, stacked financial impact)
- Tablet: 768px-1024px (2-column card grid, optimized typography)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (4-column card grid, full horizontal layout, expanded visual impact)
- Ensure smooth transitions and optimal visual impact at all breakpoints

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Proper semantic HTML structure for problem section content hierarchy
- ARIA labels for pain point cards and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements including transition CTA
- Focus indicators with sufficient contrast and visibility
- Screen reader compatibility with meaningful content descriptions
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Alternative text for all icons and visual elements

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Component props should be defined with TypeScript interfaces
- **API Calls**: Problem section components should not make API calls (pure UI components)
- **Environment Variables**: No client-side environment variable exposure needed for problem section

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components and interactive functionality
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test ProblemSection component renders with proper header and financial impact callout
  - Test pain point cards display with correct content and icons
  - Test card hover effects and micro-interactions
  - Test transition CTA functionality and accessibility
  - Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes (320px, 768px, 1024px+)
  - Create snapshot tests to prevent visual regression
  - Verify accessibility features with screen reader compatibility testing
  - Test integration with existing homepage structure and hero section
