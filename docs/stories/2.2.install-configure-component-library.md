## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/2.1.update-design-tokens-color-system.md]
- Complete Loveable design system implemented with navy primary and yellow accent colors
- Typography system configured with Inter for headings and Source Serif 4 for body text
- CSS variables created for colors, gradients, shadows, and spacing
- Custom utility classes added for brand-specific patterns
- Tailwind config updated with comprehensive design token system
- All existing components verified to work with new design tokens

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
**MUST use these exact versions:**
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.2.3 (App Router for routing and SSG)
- **UI Library**: React ~18.3.1 (Component architecture)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 (Utility-first CSS for brand design system)
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.4.5 (Type safety for configuration files)
- **Testing**: Jest / RTL ~29.7.0 (Unit testing for components)
- **Linting**: ESLint ~8.57.0 (Code linting and style enforcement)

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/ui/` - Location for shadcn/ui components (per project structure)
- `/components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration file (project root)
- `/package.json` - Dependencies will be added here
- `/src/components/` - Sample integration component location
- Test files should be alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions
- Maintain existing project structure while adding component library
- Ensure shadcn/ui components integrate with existing Tailwind setup

### Component Library Integration Requirements
**shadcn/ui Configuration:**
- Must integrate with existing Tailwind CSS ~3.4.3 setup
- Should use the Loveable design tokens from story 2.1
- Components must be installable via CLI in src/components/ui/ directory
- TypeScript support required for all components

**Lucide React Integration:**
- Consistent iconography system for the entire application
- Must work with existing TypeScript configuration
- Should integrate seamlessly with shadcn/ui components
- Version compatibility with React ~18.3.1 required

**Essential Components Needed:**
- Button: Primary interaction elements with design token integration
- Card: Content layout and information display
- Badge: Status indicators and category labels
- Separator: Visual content division and spacing
- Input: Form elements for future form implementations

### Architecture Pattern Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Jamstack Pattern**: Component library must work with static site generation
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable, self-contained React components
- **Monorepo Structure**: All component library changes contained in single repository

### Design System Integration
**Critical Requirements:**
- shadcn/ui must use the Loveable design tokens from story 2.1
- Components should inherit navy primary and yellow accent colors
- Typography system (Inter/Source Serif 4) must work with new components
- CSS variables and custom utility classes must be compatible
- No conflicts with existing Tailwind configuration

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Components should be in src/types if shared types needed
- **API Calls**: Native fetch API for any component-related API calls
- **Environment Variables**: No client-side environment variable exposure

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test file location**: Alongside component files with `.test.tsx` extension
- **Testing framework**: Jest (~29.7.0) and React Testing Library
- **Unit Tests**: Key UI components and integration functionality
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test shadcn/ui components render correctly with design tokens
  - Test Lucide React icons import and display properly
  - Test TypeScript compilation works with new dependencies
  - Test sample component integration with existing design system
  - Verify no regressions in existing component functionality
  - Test accessibility standards are maintained with new components
