### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/5-unified-project-structure.md]
**File locations for this story:**
- `/src/components/sections/BookConsultationHeroSection.tsx` - New hero section component
- `/src/app/book-a-consultation/page.tsx` - Book consultation page file (modify to include hero section)

**Architecture compliance:**
- Follow Next.js App Router pattern for component integration
- Use TypeScript for all component definitions with proper interfaces
- Maintain existing project structure while adding new section components
- Components must integrate with existing book consultation page layout, CalendlyWidget, and benefits section

### Current Book Consultation Page Architecture
**Existing Implementation:**
