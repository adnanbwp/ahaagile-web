## 1. Technical Deep Dive

### Code Structure and Architecture

The repository consists of a single Python script (`mcsforecaster.py`) with clean, modular design:

```python
# Core Functions:
- run_single_simulation()     # Individual Monte Carlo run
- run_multiple_simulations()  # Statistical aggregation
- print_histogram()          # Results visualization
- main()                     # Configuration and execution
```

**Technical Stack:**
- **Core**: Pure Python 3.x
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tabulate
- **Data Science**: Standard scientific computing libraries
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for histogram generation

### Monte Carlo Algorithm Specifics

The implementation uses a sophisticated multi-feature simulation approach:

1. **Throughput Sampling**: Randomly samples from historical daily completion rates
2. **Parallel Feature Processing**: Simulates simultaneous feature development
3. **Resource Distribution**: Allocates daily throughput across active features
4. **Probability Calculation**: Aggregates results across multiple simulation runs

**Mathematical Model:**
```
For each simulation day:
  throughput = random.choice(past_throughput)
  distribute throughput across active features
  track completion status per feature
  
Across N simulations:
  calculate completion probabilities
  generate 85th percentile estimates
  create frequency distributions
```

### Input Parameters and Data Flow

**Required Inputs:**
- `past_throughput`: Array of historical daily task completion rates
- `feature_stories`: Number of stories per feature
- `simultaneous_features`: Maximum parallel features
- `number_of_simulations`: Statistical sample size (default: 1000)
- `days_to_simulate`: Forecast duration

**Data Flow:**
1. Historical throughput data → Random sampling pool
2. Feature definitions → Work allocation matrix
3. Simulation engine → Probability distributions
4. Results aggregation → Visual outputs

### Core Mathematical Approach

The tool employs **bootstrapping** methodology:
- Uses historical performance data as probability distribution
- Assumes throughput variability follows historical patterns
- Generates confidence intervals through repeated sampling
- Provides 85th percentile completion estimates (conservative planning)

**Statistical Validity:**
- Large sample sizes (1000+ simulations) ensure statistical significance
- Bootstrap approach captures real-world variability
- Histogram outputs provide full probability distribution insights
