# 12. Epic 7: Theme Preview System Implementation

### Story 7.1: Theme Context & State Management
**As a** Developer, **I want** a robust theme management system with React Context, **so that** I can efficiently switch between Ocean, Sunset, and Forest themes across the entire application with proper state persistence.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A ThemeContext provider is created that manages theme state (Ocean, Sunset, Forest) and light/dark mode preferences.
2. Theme state is persisted in localStorage to maintain user preferences across browser sessions.
3. A custom useTheme hook is implemented to provide easy access to theme state and switching functions.
4. Theme switching logic properly handles CSS variable updates without requiring page reloads.
5. Initial theme state is properly hydrated from localStorage on application startup.
6. Theme context provides type-safe theme options and switching methods.
7. Default theme fallback behavior is implemented when no stored preference exists.

### Story 7.2: Dynamic Theme Loading System
**As a** Developer, **I want** a dynamic CSS loading system for themes, **so that** theme changes are applied instantly across all components with smooth visual transitions.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Layout component is modified to support dynamic theme CSS variable injection.
2. Theme-specific CSS variable definitions are created for Ocean, Sunset, and Forest themes.
3. Each theme includes comprehensive color palettes for both light and dark mode variants.
4. CSS transition animations are implemented for smooth theme switching without jarring visual changes.
5. Theme CSS variables properly override Tailwind CSS configuration without conflicts.
6. Theme switching maintains component styling integrity across all existing components.
7. CSS cascade behavior ensures theme variables take precedence over default styling.
8. Performance is optimized to prevent layout shifts during theme transitions.

### Story 7.3: Interactive Theme Switcher Component
**As a** Developer, **I want** an intuitive floating theme switcher interface, **so that** I can easily test and compare all three themes in real-time during development.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A floating theme switcher component is created with fixed positioning for persistent access.
2. Theme switcher displays visual color previews for Ocean, Sunset, and Forest themes.
3. Real-time theme switching is implemented without requiring page reloads or navigation.
4. Light/dark mode toggle controls are integrated within the theme switcher interface.
5. Theme switcher is fully responsive and accessible across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
6. Component provides clear visual feedback for currently selected theme and mode.
7. Theme switcher positioning does not interfere with existing page content or navigation.
8. Keyboard navigation and screen reader support are implemented for accessibility.

### Story 7.4: Integration & Testing
**As a** Developer, **I want** comprehensive integration testing of the theme system, **so that** all themes work correctly with existing components and the system is ready for theme selection decisions.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Theme switcher is integrated into the main layout component for global accessibility.
2. All existing components (header, footer, hero sections, buttons, cards) are tested with each theme variant.
3. Theme compatibility is verified across all pages (homepage, services, case study, consultation).
4. No visual regressions or styling conflicts occur when switching between themes.
5. Theme system works correctly with existing Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styling.
6. Unit tests are created for theme context, switching logic, and component rendering.
7. Theme persistence functionality is tested across browser sessions and different devices.
8. Performance impact of theme switching is measured and optimized for smooth user experience.
9. Theme system can be easily removed or disabled for production builds when theme selection is finalized.
