# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   To generate an average of 5 qualified leads per month through the website within 6 months of launch.
*   To establish Aha Agile as a credible thought leader in the intelligent automation space for professional services firms.
*   To create durable web assets (case studies, articles) that support the sales cycle and build credibility.
*   To validate the market's need for bespoke intelligent workflow solutions.

### Background Context

This project is being undertaken to address a significant operational bottleneck observed in medium-sized professional services firms. These firms are losing substantial productivity (estimated at 25-35% of weekly capacity) to inefficient, email-driven administrative workflows. The goal of the Aha Agile website is to serve as a "digital consultant" and lead-generation engine. It will attract and engage business leaders by demonstrating a clear, quantifiable return on investment from implementing bespoke, intelligent automation solutions to solve these specific pain points.

The core strategy is to de-mystify AI and technology, focusing instead on tangible business outcomes. The website will use an evidence-based approach, centered around a detailed case study, to build trust and guide qualified prospects towards a consultation.
