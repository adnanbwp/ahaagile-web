## The Hidden Cost of Manual Workflows

Your team is trapped in time-consuming, repetitive processes that drain productivity and profitability:

- **35% of weekly capacity** lost to email chaos and manual coordination
- Partners billing at $180/hour stuck on $20/hour administrative tasks  
- Client frustration from delayed responses during peak periods
- Critical work interrupted by constant context-switching

**The financial impact is staggering:** A typical 3-person professional services firm loses **$236,000 to $330,000 annually** in unrealized revenue due to workflow inefficiencies.
