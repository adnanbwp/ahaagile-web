## The Hidden Cost of Email-Driven Workflows

Your team spends up to **35% of their weekly capacity** trapped in email chaos. Sound familiar?

- **2-4 hours daily** chasing clients for documents and answering repetitive queries
- Partners billing at $180/hour stuck on $20/hour administrative tasks
- Client frustration from delayed responses during peak periods
- Critical work interrupted by constant email context-switching

**The financial impact is staggering:** A typical 3-accountant firm loses **$236,000 to $330,000 annually** in unrealized revenue due to email inefficiencies. That's not just lost time—it's lost growth, stressed staff, and clients questioning your responsiveness.

Generic inbox rules and off-the-shelf CRM systems aren't solving this. You need intelligent automation designed specifically for the nuanced, high-volume communications that professional services firms handle daily.
