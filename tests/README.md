## Running Tests

### Integration Tests (Jest)
```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test tests/integration/

# Run specific test suite
npm test tests/integration/theme-system.test.tsx
npm test tests/integration/cross-page-validation.test.tsx
```

### E2E and Visual Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run all Playwright tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ tests/visual/ tests/performance/

# Run specific test category
npx playwright test tests/e2e/theme-switching.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/visual/theme-regression.test.ts
npx playwright test tests/performance/theme-performance.test.ts

# Run tests with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Generate Test Reports
```bash
# Jest coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Playwright HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration
Tests are configured in `jest.config.js` with:
- JSDoc test environment for browser APIs
- Next.js integration for component testing
- Module path mapping for imports
- Playwright tests excluded from Jest

### Mock Implementations
- **localStorage**: Custom mock for consistent testing
- **Next.js Router**: Navigation hooks mocked
- **Theme CSS**: Dynamic loading simulation
- **Performance APIs**: Browser performance monitoring

## Theme System Architecture Testing

### üé® Three Theme Variants
- **Ocean**: Deep blue professional theme
- **Sunset**: Warm orange/red sunset colors  
- **Forest**: Natural green forest theme

### üåì Light/Dark Mode Support
- Toggle functionality testing
- CSS class application validation
- Visual contrast verification
- Accessibility compliance

### üíæ Persistence Testing
- localStorage save/load functionality
- Cross-session state maintenance
- Browser tab synchronization
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Production Configuration Testing

### Environment Variables
Tests validate production configuration options:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_SWITCHER`: Feature flag control
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_THEME`: Production theme selection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_MODE`: Production mode setting
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_THEME_TRANSITIONS`: Performance optimization

### Production Readiness
- Theme system can be disabled for production builds
- Static theme application without JavaScript
- Performance impact measurement
- Bundle size optimization validation

## Browser Compatibility Testing

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome (latest + 1 previous version)
- Firefox (latest + ESR)
- Safari (latest on macOS/iOS)
- Edge (latest stable)

### Device Testing
- Mobile responsiveness (iPhone, Android)
- Tablet compatibility (iPad, Android tablets)
- Desktop various screen resolutions
- Touch vs. mouse interaction testing

## Performance Benchmarks

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms  
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: < 600ms

### Theme Switch Performance
- Theme selection to visual update: < 1s
- CSS loading time: < 500ms
- Render completion: < 300ms
- Layout shift impact: < 0.1

## Visual Regression Testing

### Screenshot Comparison
- Component-level theme variations
- Full-page responsive testing
- Cross-browser visual consistency
- Theme transition smoothness
- Responsive breakpoint validation

### Viewport Testing
- Mobile (320px - 414px)
- Tablet (768px - 1024px) 
- Desktop (1280px - 1920px+)
- Portrait and landscape orientations

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
Tests are configured to run on:
- Pull request validation
- Main branch updates
- Release preparation
- Nightly regression testing

### Test Automation
- Unit tests: Run on every commit
- Integration tests: PR validation
- E2E tests: Pre-deployment verification
- Visual tests: Release validation
- Performance tests: Weekly benchmarks

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **localStorage Mock Issues**: Ensure mock is properly configured
2. **Theme CSS Loading**: Check dynamic import paths
3. **Component Rendering**: Verify Next.js mock setup
4. **Playwright Browser**: Run `npx playwright install`
5. **Performance Variance**: Account for test environment differences

### Debug Tools
- Jest: `--verbose` flag for detailed output
- Playwright: `--debug` for step-by-step execution
- Browser DevTools: Network and Performance tabs
- React DevTools: Component state inspection

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Test Cases
1. Identify the functionality to test
2. Choose appropriate test category (unit/integration/e2e)
3. Follow existing test patterns and naming
4. Include positive and negative test cases
5. Add performance assertions where relevant
6. Update this documentation

### Test Quality Guidelines
- Tests should be deterministic and repeatable
- Mock external dependencies appropriately  
- Use descriptive test and variable names
- Include error scenarios and edge cases
- Validate both functionality and performance
- Maintain good test isolation and cleanup
